# 1.- Write a program that works out wether if a given number is an odd or even number
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g 86 is even because 86 / 2 = 43
# 43 has no decimal places. Therefore the division is clean. 

# e.g 59 is odd because 59 / 2 = 36.875
# 36.875 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.875, so the division is not clean

# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.
